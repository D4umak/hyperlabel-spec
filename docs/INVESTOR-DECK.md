### Track Any Cargo, Anywhere

**$20 GPS Labels for the $20B Cargo Visibility Market**

## Slide 2: The Problem

### $15B Lost Annually to Cargo Blind Spots

**The Pain:**
- 70% of SMB shipments have no real-time tracking
- Cargo goes "dark" during flights, ocean transit, and remote areas
- Current solutions cost $100-500 per device

**The Quote:**
> "I ship $50K worth of electronics from China. My forwarder updates me every 3-4 days. If something goes wrong, I find out too late."
> — Amazon FBA Seller
