# HyperLabel — Investor Teaser

**GPS Tracking Labels for the $20B Cargo Visibility Market**

---

## The Problem

**$15 billion** is lost annually to cargo theft, delays, and misrouted shipments. Yet most tracking solutions cost $100-500 per device, require complex setup, and lock customers into carrier-specific platforms.

**The result:** 70% of high-value shipments travel through "black holes" where location data is unavailable—especially during flights, ocean transit, and remote regions.

---

## Our Solution

**HyperLabel** is a disposable GPS tracking label that costs **$20-25**, works in **180+ countries**, and requires **zero technical setup**.

| Feature | HyperLabel | Traditional Trackers |
|---------|------------|---------------------|
| **Price** | $20-25 (disposable) | $100-500 (reusable) |
| **Form Factor** | 10×15cm, 3.5mm thin | Bulky devices |
| **Setup** | Scan QR, peel, stick | Complex onboarding |
| **Coverage** | 180+ countries, flight/ocean | Carrier-dependent |
| **Battery** | 60+ days | Varies |

**How it works:** Buy → Peel & Stick → Track Anywhere
