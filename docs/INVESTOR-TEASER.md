# HyperLabel — Investor Teaser

**GPS Tracking Labels for the $18B Cargo Visibility Market**

---

## The Problem

**$15-25 billion** is lost annually to cargo theft, delays, and misrouted shipments globally.¹ Yet most tracking solutions cost $100-500 per device, require complex setup, and lock customers into carrier-specific platforms.

**The result:** SMB shippers have limited visibility into their cargo—especially during flights, ocean transit, and handoffs between carriers. A 2023 Gartner survey found **47% of supply chain leaders** cite real-time visibility as their top investment priority.²
